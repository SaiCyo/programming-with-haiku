== Unit 1 Review

Let's take a little time to go over what we've learned so far in this
unit. We've come quite a distance from the very beginning in Lesson 1 to
our first real project in Lesson 5. Try to answer each of the questions
below off the top of your head, but don't be afraid to go back and look
up the answers if you're stumped or a just a little fuzzy on something.
You can find the answers to all of these questions at the end of Lesson
6.
